# Privatization - Shrif Policy Research Institute - Spring 2022
This repository contains the contents of the "**Designing performance indicators for monitoring the implementation of the general policies of Iran's Constitution's Article 44**" project on Shrif Policy Research Institute.

In this research project, a dynamic evaluation framework is presented on implementing the general policies of Article 44 of the Constitution based on quantitative and measurable indicators. This framework will enable the analysis of the effects of privatization policies due to the possibility of continuous and online updating of indicators and their use to explain the causal relationships between key economic variables and privatization policies. At the same time, considering the macro performance by examining each actor's performance and providing an integrated and comprehensive database provides a suitable tool for policymakers and supervisors to use to have more effective control over the privatization process and make necessary improvements. Apply the privatization process based on these criteria.
